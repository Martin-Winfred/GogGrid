# GogGrid - Decentralized Cluster Monitoring Software

GogGrid is an open-source decentralized cluster monitoring software written in Go, designed to help you monitor nodes and resources in distributed clusters. By utilizing a decentralized architecture, GogGrid offers greater flexibility in adapting to clusters of varying scales, providing real-time monitoring to ensure your cluster remains in a healthy state.


## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** GogGrid departs from traditional single-master node architectures, opting for a decentralized design that reduces the risk of single points of failure.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Real-time collection of performance metrics and status information from nodes within the cluster, aiding in staying informed about cluster operations.

- **Scalability:** GogGrid is easily scalable, whether your cluster is small or large, ensuring it accommodates changing needs.
